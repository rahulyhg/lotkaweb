(3, 'story', 'Story document', 'Story', 'The World of Lotka-Volterra', '<hr class="divider-d mt-20" id="arrival">\r\n<h2 class="module-title font-alt mt-60">The Arrival</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nNo one knew where they came from. They appeared to our systems mere hours before they entered atmosphere. They hung there, enormous black hulks, kept still from unknown forces. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen, in one unified symphony, they unleashed destruction. The seas were vaporized by terrible bombardments, the enormous forests of the equatorial regions were set ablaze, the earth’s most precious natural resources destroyed. We, humanity, were exterminated almost as an afterthought. The tsunamis and the radioactive floods wiped out our coastlands, while the irradiated smog from the enormous fires destroyed our urban regions. Those living in rural areas watched in horror as the skies turned red, then black, as our civilization broke down.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen came the second wave. It came in silence. Thousands upon thousands of intricate machines and strange biological constructs landed all across the globe, in a massive web. They started working, overturning the earth, and their work meant death for us. Even our skies slowly turned toxic, filling with carbon monoxide and methane.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSome tried to fight while others only tried to flee. At some point, we discovered that they would not go deep underground, and so old bomb shelters, mines and subway systems became our new homes. The breakdown of communication means that only old fashioned radio waves carry our communication and they, too, are unreliable. No one knew how many others escaped into the safety of the dark. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-20" id="starving">\r\n<h2 class="module-title font-alt mt-60">The Starving Years</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAs humanity retreated into the shadows, yielding the surface of the Earth to the unknown force that had claimed it, the challenges we faced gradually changed. What had been a matter of merely surviving until the next day, the next week, became a matter of finding a way to survive for a month or even for a year. At first, it seemed and felt as if there was no hope to be had - that we had simply exchanged death by radiation or asphyxiation with a slow death from starvation. And yes, many died that way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut, in a display of the immense adaptability of mankind, we accepted the fact that our lives had been irrevocably changed, that the surface of the Earth was no longer ours and that we now had to sustain ourselves with what we had. Not even the most prepared survivalist had been able to fathom a scenario where we would be forced to abandon all that which gave us sustenance and forge something entirely new in an ecosystem never meant for us. The years that followed became known as the Starving Years. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is impossible to know how many people died in the initial attacks, but it is a certainty that most of those who had escaped died in the aftermath. Those who lived through those times often refuse to speak about them. The horrors of hunger and darkness are vivid in humanity’s genetic memory and what happened between those who had helped each other survive, once they were trapped together without food, was unspeakable.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet, even as some fell to horrible fates, others banded together and found that their new homes did hold some hope for survival. People like us, here. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe found underground food stores reached through service tunnels, a few even dared raids to the surface in a desperate attempt at scavenging food. Some built primitive hydroponic systems from the scraps that were found. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Starving Years took a terrible toll, and perhaps we would have died if it wasn’t for a few important things we learned about the Enemy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey did not seem to search for survivors, they never ventured below apart from a few rare exceptions. They did not seem intent on destroying property or stores, some of them even ignored our presence all together. We were just insects, grabbing at crumbs, while they were at work on something far greater in scope. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat is worse, do you think - being the enemy of some unknown, all-powerful Alien race, or being the irrelevant insects that sometimes get caught in their nets? Some argued that they hated us, that they feared us and wanted us destroyed as a species. Others concluded that we were just cockroaches, a nuisance but nothing more. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEven so, it meant survival, as long as there was food to loot in dangerous surface expeditions. Needless to say, everyone realized that this food would not last forever and raiding the surface to forage for game, grains or fruit sometimes yielded less calories than it took to bring it in, but it gave us some breathing room. We would have a chance to build something lasting while sustaining ourselves on the things left behind by a dead civilization.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-20" id="colony">\r\n<h2 class="module-title font-alt mt-60">Haven Colony</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the thirteen years that have passed since The Nightfall - that is what most people now call the arrival, the last nine of those have been spent building up the place called Haven. It started as a gathering of people, a few souls that managed to eke out an existence against all odds. We built it and carved it out of a subway system, connecting both old fallout shelters and storage facilities with infrastructure and power lines. It became our great sprawling web of life. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt first, there was no real organization here. Everyone did what they could - some took up leadership roles just out of habit, others were elected by small groups to lead their particular efforts. It took almost a year until the first military-trained people took command of the defenses and made their own little hierarchy within a previously rather loose-governed group. There were a dozen different groups and at least twenty small micro-societies within the bigger one, and growing as more people found their way down.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the year after that, media channels started cropping up, growing alongside the cables that were branching out within Haven’s webbing. Elections were called, and the concept of citizenry was instated. It included everyone living in the colony at the time, but no others. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLooking back, we all remember the results, but truth be told is that it wasn’t a smooth process. People died, people were pushed out, ideas fought ideas through political organizing. It is as any birth of a nation - chaotic, bloody, messy but inevitable and ultimately necessary. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nToday, Haven Colony is ruled in two different ways. You have the Citizen Council, elected on a two year basis, then there’s the Operations, the military hierarchy that do not have any elections but whose high-ups are in close contact with the Council. Then, there are the four Whistles, the whistleblowers, individuals elected to be the watchers of the watchers. They’re sworn to silence, but also get to sit in on all the meetings with the Council, the Operations or between the two. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt took a long hard political fight to get that idea through, but now we have something that is starting to look like a democracy. For citizens, at least. The people who’ve come later get to enter a probationary period of at least a year, to earn their keep. Air and food is not free here, and everyone has to contribute. If you’re taking it up and not giving back, someone else goes without the things they need. Is it fair? Maybe not. We just happened to be first. But, it is necessary - they weren’t here to build up Haven, we were. We had to do the dirty work, the hard work, but we carried through. We made this for us, and for them, and now they can reap the rewards. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe don’t get that many stragglers any more. If you’re on the surface you’re either dead or crazy, but it still happens sometimes. Families or small groups who’ve been living all this time up there, skulking about at night and dodging machines and living off who knows what. We take them in unless they’re batshit crazy of course, since they’re obviously survivor material. Others we turn away, and sometimes they make trouble for us. We can’t have trouble.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll in all, now, Haven has roughly four thousand people living under ground. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-20" id="outpost">\r\n<h2 class="module-title font-alt mt-60">The Outpost</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nA few years after we founded Haven, it became apparent that its situation was unsustainable. It was growing too large, too fast, and everything from waste disposal to air recycling, from living space to plantation area was running out. In the paranoia and wariness over somehow attracting the attention of the Enemy, the colony had limits and extreme restrictions built into its very foundation. In order to both expand and also preserve its unique position, the Outpost program was founded.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGroups of individuals were chosen according to a diverse set of needed skills and sent out into the furthest and most promising tunnels. Some of them even traversed short stretches above ground in the search for more suitable areas to inhabit. Four teams were sent out - three teams reported back. One team never did, not even to this day. Two of the teams had found areas suitable for habitation - one close by Haven, one further away, and both were instructed to start building infrastructure and settle in for the long haul. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat is how the nascent new version of human civilization slowly started creeping out of its hole and out into the anthill that used to be the underground world of our old cities. The first two outposts were established; Sparta and Ithaca.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJust six months ago, four years after the first ones were sent out, we sent out two teams to locate suitable areas for new outposts. Two months ago, they came back to us, reporting that they’d found a place, a massive underground fallout shelter, protected from the ravages of the world to a large degree. The surface around it had promising areas and its radiation and toxicology levels were low enough that short-time exposure was possible. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOnce more, we decided to send brave citizens out to do what had seemed impossible - to reclaim our future, to settle new land for the people of Haven. You are those citizens, you are the second wave of people to inhabit the Outpost, chosen to make landfall and make it more permanent for the people who will come to live there. You will spend six months there before you can return home. You are the forerunners and the builders, the engineers and the leaders, the hydro-farmers and the soldiers that Haven and humanity needs. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class="module-title font-alt">You are Outpost Thermopylae.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs an outpost, you have a wide variety of duties. Your primary task is military in nature: you are to provide intelligence and reconnaissance of Enemy movements and activities, and report it back to Haven. Every piece of information, every captured data communication or scrap of alien technology we can get our hands on increases not only our chances of survival but our ability to strike back.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou are also tasked with making repairs and upgrading the Outpost to a better state, and to occasionally forage on the surface for materials and supplies.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-20" id="teams">\r\n<h2 class="module-title font-alt mt-60">The Teams</h2>\r\n<p>[team setup descriptor]</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class="font-alt mb-0 mt-40">Maintenance</h4>\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-10 mb-20">\r\n<p>[team descriptor]</p>\r\n<a class="btn btn-border-w btn-round btn-block" href="{{ site.navPath }}story/maint">Read more about Maintenance</a>\r\n\r\n<h4 class="font-alt mb-0 mt-40">Surface Operations</h4>\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-10 mb-20">\r\n<p>[team descriptor]</p>\r\n<a class="btn btn-border-w btn-round btn-block" href="{{ site.navPath }}story/surfops">Read more about Surface Operations</a>\r\n\r\n<h4 class="font-alt mb-0 mt-40">Outpost Command</h4>\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-10 mb-20">\r\n<p>[team descriptor]</p>\r\n<a class="btn btn-border-w btn-round btn-block" href="{{ site.navPath }}story/command">Read more about Outpost Command</a>\r\n\r\n<h4 class="font-alt mb-0 mt-40">Mission Control</h4>\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-10 mb-20">\r\n<p>[team descriptor]</p>\r\n<a class="btn btn-border-w btn-round btn-block" href="{{ site.navPath }}story/miscon">Read more about Mission Control</a>\r\n\r\n<h4 class="font-alt mb-0 mt-40">The Other</h4>\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-10 mb-20">\r\n<p>[team descriptor]</p>\r\n<a class="btn btn-border-w btn-round btn-block" href="{{ site.navPath }}story/other">Read more about The Other</a>\r\n', 'command.jpg', NULL, 2, 100, NULL, 1, '', '2017-09-14 00:06:52', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '2017-09-14 00:09:43', '2017-09-14 01:17:12'),

There will be nothing in canon that is “supernatural” or breaks the internal logic of hard science. The Enemy, however, has technology that is far ahead of our own, but nothing “magic”.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-20" id="play_style">\r\n<h2 class="module-title font-alt mt-60">Collaborative play-style</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is not primarily a larp of conflict between player blocs or factions, as is usually the case. You are all part of the same team, working towards a common goal, in a society that is relatively stable. We are not looking for major upheaval during the larp, or a “larp revolution”. There will, however, be plenty of room for intrapersonal conflict as well as ideological conflict over a few important values within the Outpost. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-20" id="ideal360">\r\n<h2 class="module-title font-alt mt-60">360&deg; design ideals</h2>\r\n<p>Our aim is to keep as close to the 360 design ideal as possible, meaning that everything you see, touch and interact with should feel “real”. As little abstraction as possible (within reason). That also means that any meta-techniques used will be designed to be as discreet as possible, and not breaking immersion for bystanders.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere will also be no act breaks or downtime, the larp will be played actively around the clock.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-20" id="workshops">\r\n<h2 class="module-title font-alt mt-60">Workshops & Briefings</h2>\r\n<p>Before the larp there will be extensive briefings on-site, giving you all the information and hands-on training you need to perform your specific tasks, using the tech at hand etc. There will also be time to get to know your squad mates and meet the people you have relationships with face to face.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-20" id="wider_world">\r\n<h2 class="module-title font-alt mt-60">Wider world simulation</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to create a sense of a wider world outside the bunker we will have an NPC team online at all times, simulating people in Haven Colony. You will receive emails or have chat conversations with people back in the Colony, orders or requests will trickle down and there will also be time for video calls.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe wider world outside the Colony will also be present, in the form of NPCs and technology portraying the Enemy.

They’re your buddies and comrades, the people you spend the majority of your day with and who you share history with. We want to create tight, close teams, and a healthy amount of pride and competition between teams.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor maintenance teams your working day will include tasks such as scrubbing (going around the outpost with detectors looking for spore infestations, and cleaning them out), repairing things around the outpost, building things, working in the kitchen or mess hall, handling water transportation and recycling etc. Some of you will also take part in foraging on the surface.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMISCON teams will primarily man the systems in the Ops Centre - sensor data, communications, navigation for SURFOPS, expedition logs etc, but you will also be involved in briefing and debriefing surface teams.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSurface Operations teams will have the bulk of their shifts at night, since the Enemy is more active during daytime, but you will also do daytime shifts actings as internal security. You will go on missions on the surface, guided by MISCON. Some typical missions are recon (gathering intelligence or observing Enemy movements or activities), foraging (protecting Maintenance teams as they gather supplies or repairing communication relays), “milk runs” (ie going topside to repair sensors or taking soil samples) and offensive action such as sabotage and combat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Command staff consist of commanders (who have overall authority of the Outpost), specialists and aides. The aides assist the commanders in taking notes, delivering orders or delegating work, and the specialists do some rather specialized things that we will not detail just yet. The Command staff is heavily involved in MISCON/SURFOPS and the day to day assignment of work and schedules for the Outpost.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere will be other subgroups and work assignments as well, such as medics, counselors, quartermaster etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-20" id="conflict">\r\n<h2 class="module-title font-alt mt-60">Conflict & Drama</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile both the Colony and the Outpost is working towards common goals, there will undoubtedly be conflicts, both ideological and personal.

To accomplish this, we narrowed down the people of Outpost Thermopylae to a set of values and opinions, social contexts and obligations and designed the characters from their positions in this matrix.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nRelationships and connections are created according to a different system, where most of the details will be filled in by the players. The relationships will be given meaning and depth by you, but we will provide the tools and the grid of connections that you can build upon.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn top of these two sets of data and connections, each character has a few keywords that are assigned according to their values and connections, that give them an archetype. This archetype is up for interpretation and you can build upon it as you desire.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-20">\r\n<h2 class="module-title font-alt mt-60">The values of Thermopylae</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nEach character is defined by their stance on several different points of contention. They are also defined by their position on scales of ideology. Here we present the various categories that divide the masses of the Outpost.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><b>Isolationist</b> vs <b>Interventionist</b></li>\r\n    <li><b>Militarist</b> vs <b>Democrat</b></li>\r\n    <li><b>Nostalgic</b> vs <b>Progressive</b></li>\r\n    <li><b>Libertine</b> vs <b>Collectivist</b></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b class="font-alt">Isolationism</b> is the term used in Haven for the philosophy of seeking safety in isolation from the Enemy, rather than seeking confrontation with the enemy. Isolationists often focus on new inventions, making life better where they are, new ways of growing food in the dark or ways of becoming more secure and more safe in the underworld. Strong isolationists would rather close off topside entirely and focus all of humanity’s resources on creating a sustainable life in the dark. The reasons for being isolationist can be anything from being afraid that humanity will provoke the Enemy, crushed after losing friends to surface ops, an attitude that you have to focus on what you have instead of what you don’t, or many other possible reasons. Many isolationists oppose the word “colony” and instead want to come up with an entirely new term for their new home.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b class="font-alt">Interventionistic</b> is the stance that only through intervention against the Enemy or interaction with the surface can humanity’s fate be improved. Interventionists are split into two different methods, avoiders or engagers. Avoiders are of the opinion that the best way of ensuring survival, is staying clear of the Enemy and taking things without being noticed, and they argue that the colonists have to find better ways at using the resources on the surface, better at finding means of cleaning toxic waste and combating radiation and learning more about the Enemy so you could adapt to them. Engagers want to take the fight to the Enemy, learn how to destroy them and sabotage whatever it is that they are doing, while also taking back what is humanity’s birthright - the surface. They focus on military technology and solving immediate survival topside, as well as understanding the Enemy so they can win the ‘Great War’ in the long run.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b class="font-alt">Militarists</b> consider a military rule of both Haven and the Outposts to be the right way of governing. Society needs to be militarized and constantly on guard against threats both from without but also from within, from those who would destabilize society and risk the loss of all human life. The militarists believe that democracy leads to inefficiency and squabbling and even if it is a pretty utopia, it is unrealistic in the current state of things. They often argue that as long as resources are scarce, a strong military rule is required to regulate the flow of goods and communication. Also, a military rule is needed in order to ensure vigilance against new threats from the Enemy. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b class="font-alt">Democrats</b> either argue that the military rule had its place, but that enough time has passed and enough stability has been achieved that all governing power should be handled over to the people, or that military rule never had any legitimacy and that the people should be in control of the military. They consider the fact that the military refuses to completely yield control or even refuse to bring it up a great sin against the virtues of humanity, and that Haven should take this chance to build a more equal, better society - not one that repeats all the mistakes of the society that was left behind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b class="font-alt">Nostalgics</b> cling to the past, on an emotional and intellectual level. They listen to old music, they keep clothes from the time before the Nightfall and they try to live their lives as if things are going on like they remember them. It is what Earth used to be, what society used to be, that motivates them and drives them to keep on going. It might be a family lost, an ideal kept or the beauty of what once existed that keeps them in the past, but they do not want to let go. They think that life in the outpost and in Haven should emulate the past and try to rebuild some of the beautiful things that were lost. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b class="font-alt">Progressives</b> see Haven as a new start, a new way of life. They want to create new culture, completely different from before and adapted to the new ways of life. Haven is a melting pot of different ethnicities and backgrounds and no culture would represent all the things that were lost - it is better, they say, to make this new world our own and make it unique. New styles of music are appearing and in Haven, where uniforms are less regulated, clothing styles are being invented. The creative Progressives are excited for the chance to truly make a mark in history, while more pessimistic-leaning ones see this path as one of necessity, where any attempts to cling to the past will only result in tragedy. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b class="font-alt">Libertines</b> treasure freedom, a difficult concept in a world so dictated by the need to survive. However, some within Haven and Thermopylae treasures the rights to own property, the freedom of expression, the right to be yourself and to decide what to do with your life, the right to love or form a family with whomever you choose and many others. Not everyone agree on all of them, but the principle is the same - it is not up to the state or any governing body to tell them that they cannot own what they find, have a child if they wished, or that they are not allowed to contribute to the larger society in their own way. The radicals even go as far as to say that without freedoms, human society is worth nothing, for it would just be a lifeless machine, just like the Enemy. Less radical Libertines are simply treasuring their differences, the way they stand out from the masses, and they argue for a weakening of the rigid survivalist principles that were put in place right after Nightfall. These rules were kept out of habit, not because they are needed anymore, the Libertines argue.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b class="font-alt">Collectivists</b> are those who argue that Haven and society at large is still in an ongoing crisis and only the most necessary, the most essential of resources should be spent. Everything else should be saved and tightly regulated. The rights of any individual is far below the rights of the collective, and survival of the many is always more important than any single life. Ownership should be kept to a minimum and no one should get too attached to what they have, since the Colony should always redistribute it if it would do more good somewhere else. Adhering to strict rules and having every hour of your day decided by someone else is not a problem to the collectivists or they accept it as a necessary burden.\r\n</p>', '../../../img/6.jpg', NULL, 4, 100, 9, 1, '', '2017-09-14 02:11:39', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '2017-09-14 02:19:59', '2017-09-14 03:06:56'),

Expect outside temperatures at max 12°C daytime and somewhere around 0°C at night (it can drop below zero). Being underground should give us a base temperature of around 10°C, so be prepared for that. There will be heaters in some places (we will aim to keep dormitories and work areas heated), but the bunker is huge and heating it up to normal room temperatures will be impossible, take that into account.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    You will basically not see daylight during the larp, even if your character has surface missions. The Outpost will be dark and can be claustrophobic. Take this into account as well.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The bunker system has been kept well ventilated and dry, and we didn’t detect any mold when we were there, but if you know that you are sensitive to exposure then it might be better not to take the risk.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Surface Missions will be conducted at night, meaning you will be wandering around potentially rough terrain with some elevation in some places, in the dark. If you are physically unable to do this, don’t sign up for SURFOPS.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    You sleep in shifts, and for some of you those shifts are way off from your normal sleep cycle. Beware that there is very little (if any) possibility to take an extra/different sleep shift, and limited off-game sleep areas.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class="divider-w mt-20" id="accessibility">\r\n<h2 class="module-title font-alt mt-60">Accessibility</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n    Due to both the nature of the underground location and the game elements that take place on the surface the accessibility in this venue a challenge. If you have an impairment of some sort and have questions about this, don’t hesitate to contact us.

With your support we can not only make the larp better, you also help subsidize tickets for players of lesser means. By buying a Supporter ticket you also receive goodies like a limited edition Supporter\r\n          t-shirt, and opportunity to select character name (from a preseeded list). Best of all is that you are guaranteed to end up in the group you select (eg. Maintenance, SURFOPS, etc.).</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Standard ticket</strong>, 2 600 SEK.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Subsidized ticket</strong>, 1 700 SEK.

It also allows you to split the payment into partials. If you are paying by credit card, please use Stripe instead since it incurs less of a transaction fee for us.\r\n      If you pay using Swish you will receive an email with instructions on how to pay.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      If you choose Klarna partial payments or Swish, <em>do not</em> use our own partial tickets, instead go for a full ticket.\r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <hr class="divider-w mt-20">\r\n    <h3 class="font-alt mt-60">Terms</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n      For partial-payment tickets, we need your first payment before <strong>October 1st</strong>, and full payment before <strong>November 30th</strong> 2017.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Tickets are, generally, non-refundable but are transferrable (with organizer approval).
