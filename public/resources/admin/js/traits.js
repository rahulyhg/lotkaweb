When things go wrong on the surface, they really go to shit. Someone makes one reckless move, they lose control, people get killed, and all their knowledge and equipment are lost with them. You cannot believe that some people are willing to take such a risk. And for what? To spy on an enemy, to whom you are nothing more than cockroaches? To risk your life for an expired can of dog food? If you are to survive in this world, where everything you knew is a charred shadow of what it once was, you need to be realistic. The surface, that once sustained us all, is a toxic wasteland. It is no longer ours, and we need to stay away from it. ", "While you can remember several successful surface operations, much more of them led to people dying some horrible unimaginable death.

You would feel sorry for these fools, if their stupidity did not put the entire Colony at risk. Seeing the most resourceful members of the Colony cheerfully devote themselves to certain death really grinds your gears. You needed these people for building a society. You needed them to find sustainable ways to feed the colony. Instead, so many lives go to waste. And worst of all, every encounter with the enemy attracts attention.

There's nothing but death and destruction above, and no surface goal can ever be worth the risk it will take.

		"high": ["Sure, there are plenty of things to be unhappy about, but what does that help? While others sit around complaining, you move forward with a stubborn, eternally positive belief that you will succeed. You've been burnt a few times - but your heart is still pumping warm blood through your veins, and the world is still worth fighting for, full of love and chaos and hope, and precious moments. As long as you're in any way able, you'll continue to believe in tomorrow. It's the only way to live!", "You truly live for others. Even in the darkest times, you always gave of your food and water, you worked when others faltered and you dragged yourself out of bed in order to compensate for someone who was sick. You know there are few people like you, but that hasn't made you bitter or ungrateful. It simply means that you have to go even further to help as others seem incapable. There are of course things that bring you down - truly egoistic people, narcissists that care only for themselves. People like that are a plague upon this new, harsh world.", "Look at you, how lucky you are to be alive right now. You never miss a day without thanking whatever or whoever is to be thanked for that. It's a miracle you're alive, it's a miracle you found Haven and your new friends and new life here. And it's fantastic that you can do even better, working here in outpost Thermopylae to ensure the bright future of all mankind."]
