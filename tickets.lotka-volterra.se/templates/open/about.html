<h2>Survival against all odds</h2>
<p>Lotka-Volterra is an international scifi larp set in a bleak near future where mankind is all but extinct, preyed upon by technologically superior alien threat, but nevertheless surviving against all odds. You will be playing one of the survivors of <i>Haven Colony</i>, doing a several months long duty shift at the semi-military outpost of <i>Thermopylae</i>.</p>
